ðŸ“Š Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis in E-commerce

This project explores Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction in e-commerce using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and various data preprocessing techniques. With a dataset of 100,000 transactions, the goal is to model CLV based on revenue, units sold, discounts, and regional differences while tackling challenges like non-normality and heteroscedasticity.

ðŸ”Ž Key Highlights

- EDA & Outlier Handling â€“ Comparing removal vs. capping (pmin method)
- GLM Model Selection â€“ Gamma family with log, inverse & identity links
- Homoscedasticity Checks â€“ Ensuring the best fit for CLV prediction
- AIC-Based Model Comparison â€“ Evaluating Gaussian vs. Gamma performance

ðŸ”¬ Why This Matters

Accurately predicting CLV helps e-commerce businesses optimize customer retention, marketing spend, and personalized recommendations. This project provides an in-depth, data-driven approach to CLV modeling, perfect for analysts and AI enthusiasts alike.

ðŸ“Œ Lesson learned? The binomial link function isnâ€™t always the answer, but data exploration and the right statistical tools lead to valuable insights. ðŸš€
